# Roles

Four roles, all sharing the same Supabase Auth. Role is decided purely by table
membership — no row in `admins`/`moderators` = regular user, row in
`moderators` = moderator, row in `admins` = admin. Admin **is** a moderator
(`is_moderator()` returns true for admins too); a moderator is **not** an admin.

## Visitor (signed out)

- Lands on `/`. Can read the landing page, EULA, privacy policy, data-usage page.
- `/app` shows a teaser of `preview_profiles_count` active profiles via the
  `preview_profiles` RPC (WhatsApp hidden, report disabled) if that count is
  `> 0`; otherwise a hard "join to see profiles" gate immediately
  (`AuthGateModal`, mode `auth`).
- Can sign up (email or an enabled OAuth provider) or log in. Can request a
  password reset email (`/reset-password`) without being signed in.
- Cannot read the real feed at all — enforced server-side by RLS
  (`has_own_profile()` + `active = true`), not just the UI popup.

## User — no profile yet

- Has a Supabase Auth account but no row in `profiles` with `owner_id` set to
  them.
- `/app` shows the "Te falta tu perfil" gate (`AuthGateModal`, mode `profile`)
  instead of the feed.
- Can go through `/register`: share the app N times, then fill the profile
  form. The new row always inserts `active = false` (pending) — enforced by
  RLS, not the client — **unless** the WhatsApp number matches an unclaimed
  migrated (seed) profile, in which case `claim_migrated_profile` assigns that
  row to them and it stays active (no re-review).
- If the number is already owned by someone else's real profile, they can file
  an ownership claim ("Es mío") for a moderator to review — no automatic
  reassignment.
- One profile per account (unique index on `owner_id`), one profile per
  WhatsApp number (unique index on `whatsapp`).

## User — has a profile

- Everything above, plus: once `active = true` (approved), sees and swipes the
  real feed, opens WhatsApp, reports other profiles.
- `/account`: read-only summary by default; "Edit profile" reveals the
  editable form. Can change name, description, gender, interested-in,
  interests, region, visibility (hide / hide-until-date), and replace their
  photo — all through the `update_own_profile` RPC, which only ever touches
  the caller's own row and a whitelisted column set. Cannot touch
  `active`, `report_count`, `owner_id`, `whatsapp`, or `birthdate` — cannot
  self-approve or spoof ownership.
- Photo replacement is direct (no re-moderation) — a deliberate simplicity
  trade-off, revisit if it's abused.
- Can change their password from `/account` or request a reset email while
  logged out.
- Getting reported `report_threshold` times auto-disables the profile via a DB
  trigger — no moderator action needed.

## Moderator

- Everything a regular user can do, plus access to the moderator route
  (`/admin/moderator`) — the only staff route they can reach. The admin and
  config routes answer "not authorized" for them.
- Sees their own stats: approved by me, denied by me, pending count, and
  skipped today (skipped-today is a local per-device counter, not a DB value —
  it resets at local midnight and isn't shared across devices).
- Moderation deck: any drag/arrow swipe is always a **skip**. Approve and deny
  are explicit buttons only.
  - **Approve** applies once `moderation_approve_quorum` distinct moderators
    have voted (default 1 — so a single moderator approving still works
    instantly unless the config is raised).
  - **Deny** requires a reason from a fixed pick-list and applies once
    `moderation_deny_quorum` distinct moderators have voted (default 3).
  - Denying an **unclaimed migrated (seed)** profile deletes the row outright
    instead of soft-denying it — a seed row has no real person behind it, and
    a permanent denied stub would squat the WhatsApp number forever.
- Cannot see global admin stats, cannot search/promote/remove staff, cannot
  open the admin or config routes.

## Admin

- Everything a moderator can do (`is_moderator()` is true for admins too),
  plus:
  - Can move between the admin and moderator routes from the nav bar (they are
    separate URLs, not two views of one page).
  - Admin route shows global stats: total/active/pending/banned profiles, and
    database-wide counters (fake profiles, migrated total/unclaimed, accounts
    with no profile at all) — these counters are **never** affected by dev
    flags or the panel's own filtered profiles query; they're always the true
    totals.
  - A single admin vote **always** applies an approve or deny immediately,
    bypassing the moderator quorum entirely.
  - Can search any user account by email and promote them to moderator or
    admin — each promotion requires a confirmation dialog.
  - Can remove a moderator or another admin — each removal requires a
    confirmation dialog. Cannot remove themselves from the admins list (guard
    against accidental self-lockout).
  - Sees a floating `</>` button (right edge, semi-transparent) opening a
    dev-flags panel: show only fake profiles, bypass the release-date gate,
    show only unclaimed migrated profiles, bypass the daily swap/click limit,
    show the migrated stat. These are per-device localStorage toggles for QA —
    **not** a security boundary, and never affect the global stats counters.
    Hidden (and the stored flags purged) when `show_dev_settings_to_admins` is
    false in `dev-config.json`.
  - Sees a banner in the admin route linking to the **config** route: a
    read-only view of `app-config.json`, `app-links.json` and
    `dev-config.json`, one collapsible panel each. Hidden, and the route
    itself closed, when `show_app_settings_to_admins` is false.
  - Both switches are all-or-nothing for admins today. Narrowing them to
    specific admin emails is a planned follow-up (see `DESIGN.md` §9).

## Notes

- The first admin has to be created by hand (Supabase Auth user + a row in
  `admins`, via SQL) — see `SETUP.md`. Every admin after that can be promoted
  from the panel, no SQL needed.
- Staff routes are plain fixed URLs: `/admin`, `/admin/moderator`,
  `/admin/config`. There is no secret path — the old `VITE_ADMIN_PATH` shipped
  inlined in the JS bundle, so it only deterred casual URL guessing. The actual
  boundary is the staff login + RLS.
- All of the above server-side rules live in `supabase/migrations/` — the
  client-side checks (popups, disabled buttons) are UX, not the real gate.
